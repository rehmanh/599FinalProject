## Final Project
## 4-Way Traffic Light Optimization System
## Habib ur Rehman && Omar Abdelmotaleb

This package contains the scripts necessary to perform data analysis on our gathered Physical and Virtual Data
for our experiments on traffic lights. 

The Python file `analysis.py` contains functions to perform data analysis and plot visualizations. It also contains the data collected from our real-world and simulated experiments. 

To run the file, make sure the following dependencies are installed:
1. Python version >= 3.8
2. `numpy` for math/statistics operations
3. `matplotlib` for plotting visualizations
4. `scipy` for correlation and statistical tests
